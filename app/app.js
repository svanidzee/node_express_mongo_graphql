// You DO NOT NEED express.json() and express.urlencoded() for GET Requests or DELETE Requests
// You NEED express.json() and express.urlencoded() for POST and PUT requests, because in both
// these requests you are sending data (in the form of some data object) to the server and you
// are asking the server to accept or store that data (object), which is enclosed in the body
// (i.e. req.body) of that (POST or PUT) Request
// Express provides you with middleware to deal with the (incoming) data (object) in the body of the request
// a. express.json() is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON Object
// This method is called as a middleware in your application using the code: app.use(express.json())
// b. express.urlencoded() is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object
// as strings or arrays. This method is called as a middleware in your application
// using the code: app.use(express.urlencoded());
